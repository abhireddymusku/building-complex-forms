###### \#011 - Building Complex Forms

In this recipe, we'll learn how to build a complex form made up of multiple templates. We'll learn how to handle different types of user input, control the shape of our data using a schema, and work in a bit of validation to ensure the data we insert into our database is clean. We'll also learn how to use ReactiveDict to help us manage form state.
